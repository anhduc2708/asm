<h1> IT profile </h1>
<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<p> Include your name, student number, email address, and some basic background information (nationality and culture, education to date, spoken languages etc.). Include at least one fact about yourself that others may find interesting, such as a hobby, a pet or your favourite sport or other pastime. </p>

<h2> Interest in IT </h2>

<ul>

<li>You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length. </li>
<li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </li>
<li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </li>
<li>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </li>
</ul>

<h2> Ideal Job </h2>
<p> Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience, and hence be something that you have to work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as soon as you graduate. There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like<a href='https://itviec.com'> https://itviec.com </a> or <a href = 'https://www.vietnamworks.com'> https://www.vietnamworks.com </a> . You should include the following information. </p>

<ul>
<li> The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link expires before the assignment deadline).  </li>
<li> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appeals to you.  </li>
<li> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position.  </li>
<li> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experience you currently have.  </li>
<li> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<p>
There are a number of online tests that are commonly used by employers to get specific information about potential employees. One of the best-known of these is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test, which was developed by the mother-and-daughter team of Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs. Another popular one (and very relevant to students) is about learning styles. There are various other tests available online as well, and while there is no guarantee that any specific test will be necessarily one that you will encounter in your career, it seems highly likely that you will have to do some kind of test like this as part of a recruitment process.

Accordingly, you are required to present the following
<ul>
<li> The results of an online Myers-Briggs test. </li>
<li> The results of an online learning style test. </li>
<li> The results of one further online test of your choosing. </li>
</ul>
The third test should be distinct from both the Myers-Briggs test and the learning styles test. This could be a Big Five Personality test, a creativity test, or a psychometric test. You should be able to find something free, and please ensure that it is something that a potential employer may find relevant (so please avoid things like a Nerdy Personality Attribute assessment or a Generic Conspiracist Beliefs test!).

In addition to the results themselves, you should answer each of the questions below with one paragraph.
<ul>
<li> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </li>
<li> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </li>
<li> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> Project Ideas </h2>
<p>
You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your project idea. You should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.

What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? What project will help you develop the skills, experience, and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?

You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on others.

There are a number of possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential ideas are below; others will be discussed in class.
<ul>
<li> Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d. </li>
<li> Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you have the expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor. </li>
<li>
Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, small robots or related technologies. </li>
<li> Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software. </li>
<li> Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along the lines of the United Nations Block by Block project. </li>
</ul>
For this assignment, you need to write approximately 1,000 words about your project idea.

This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are recommendations only.
