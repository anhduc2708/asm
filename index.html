<h2 style="color:blue"> Interest in IT  </h2>
<li>I have found that IT is one of the most important things is this 4.0 era and I can solve many problems if I good at this major. I started to like this major since I was 15 after watching a video from a Vietnamese guy making his AI called virtual assistant like Siri of  Apple or Cortana of Microsoft. This Vietnamese guy got his master of AI certificate when he was 21 in Swinburne university and he also the lead tutor of AI in this school at the moment. And I was made my first virtual assistant by using his instruction without any knowledge about python. </li>
<li>I heard many people talk about the quality of RMIT, also my cousin is an alumnus of this school. He truly good at this major and have a wonderful job at a Finnish programming company. So I want to study in this school and gain a lot of soft skills and essential knowledge from the lectures.</li>
<li>During study, I hope to have good skills  and knowledge to develop that I can find my dream job in the future. In addition, maybe during my studies I can realize the most suitable sector which I belong to.</li>

<h2 style="color:blue">Ideal Job </h2>

<li> iPhone and IOS are very hot in recent 10 years, but according to <a href= " https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/iphone-vs-android-market-share-3691861/"> an article from Macworld website </a> , android sales still took nearly 75% in the world and 74% on the China market. So I can see there is a great demand in this line of work and the opportunity for this major is enormous. Also, I love to do something creative and android platform allows customization of almost the entire system so it's definitely an ideal choice for me in the future.</li>
<li>Technology changes every day which means people who work in this industry have to learn every day, update the tech news, adapt to it, and develop themselves. Moreover, this position requires an IT that has good knowledge and a deep understanding of this operating system because Android is vulnerable to software conflicts while customizing.</li>
<li>	To be honest, at the moment, I don’t know anything with the exception of some simple syntax of python, turtle, terminal and git commands. So hopefully I will have every essential knowledge such as coding in some popular programming languages like C++, Java or Python… Beside, soft skills are very important for people who work in a professional company.</li>

<h2 style="color:blue">Project idea</h2>

<br> -	In general, my project is about an app using for Bitcoin trading. This app is similar to an online currency wallet for people who need to purchase online.  In recent years, bitcoin has been very popular with the Vietnamese and most of the people lost their money is because of the security and privacy of the app. Therefore, I will focus mostly on the security of the users. The app will allow users to invest in many kinds of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum,  ripple, or dash... The app also focuses on user-friendly so the display will be a simple, smooth interface like the way Apple used to do.
<br> -	This project is very potential due to the development of bitcoin in recent years. Bitcoin had gone from around $1000 to $15000 in one year alone shows how much faith people have in crypto, <a href="https://www.smartbitcoininvestments.com/why-bitcoin-valuable-will-part-future/#:~:text=Cryptocurrency%20is%20definitely%20the%20future,have%20on%20our%20financial%20future" > according to the Smart Bitcoin Investment website </a> . Moreover, in the circumstance of the Coronavirus pandemic at the moment, the demand for purchase online is very high.  The users can use our app to work, earn money without having a meeting face-to-face.
<br> - The app allows people to create their profile, set avatar, and add some information that they want others to know. About password, they can choose the method of security, it can be the traditional password or high-tech methods like TouchID, FaceID and especially is Iris Recognition for some Samsung products. Also, users can create different wallets to store many different kinds of crypto. Besides, to negotiate, users can chat with each other, create a group chat and secret chat. Moreover, users can use emoji icons, stickers or gif to express their emotions. Those features are truly effective for their trading which are very popular in many famous apps such as Messenger, Instagram and Snapchat...  About the UI ( User Interface), users have many kinds of dark mode customized according to some popular apps like Messenger with a few changes to suit more client ages. About the UX ( User Experience), no verification for the first $2000 is applied to attract new users. Credit/debit Cards and paypal accepted, We will connect to every bank in Vietnam and some popular International banks such as Shinhan to make preferential loans for the customers. Competitive Spreads are also applied for calculating purposes. The app can save successful trades information which means it will contain the trader's information, time and the amount of money,…
<br> -	The application requires Android version 6.0 and IOS 11 or above. I will use the Java programming language and android studio tool for android devices, the swift programming language and the Xcode tool for IOS devices to optimizing and boosting user experience. The app will also have the computer version, for those people who prefer to work on the computer, Window and macOS both.
<br> -	The project will cost a lot of time and effort to be complete which means the developers will have to very patient and have good knowledge about making apps. Also, they ought to have the soft skill to mingle with others cause this project is developed by many teams for many parts such as data, a server to save the data of users, UX, UI,... Moreover, we have to provide a data system stored in a supercomputer that strong enough to keep the sever stable.
<br> -	If the project is successful, we will help a lot of users from desperate finding the way to purchase bitcoin. It will be easier for them to purchase and earn money without negotiating face-to-face or direct deals especially during the Coronavirus pandemic at the moment.
